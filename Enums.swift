/*
    I think enums are usually used for type comparisons. That's why you will use lot switch-case with enums
*/




//The values defined in an enumeration (such as north, south, east, and west) are its enumeration cases.
//You use the case keyword to introduce new enumeration cases.
enum CompassPoint {
    case north
    case south
    case east, west //declaring multiple cases statements in one statement
}
//Now CompassPoint acts like a datatype and the possible values for this datatype are north, south, east, west. This is the best explanation bro!

var directionToHead = CompassPoint.west //(or) var directionToHead: CompassPoint = CompassPoint.west
directionToHead = .east //The type of directionToHead is already known, and so you can drop the type when setting its value.

/*  Use in switch-case Statement  */
switch directionToHead {  
case .north:  //no need of CompassPoint.north
    print("Lots of planets have a north")
case .south:
    print("Watch out for penguins")
case .east:
    print("Where the sun rises")
case .west:
    print("Where the skies are blue")
} // Prints "Watch out for penguins"

//Note: As described in Control Flow, a switch statement must be exhaustive when considering an enumerationâ€™s cases. If the case for .west is omitted, this code does not compile, because it does not consider the complete list of CompassPoint cases.
//Requiring exhaustiveness ensures that enumeration cases are not accidentally omitted. (When it is not appropriate to provide a case for every enumeration case, you can provide a default case to cover any cases that are not addressed explicitly)

/*  Enums in Function */
enum Status {
case success, failure
}

func doSomething(inout result: String) -> Status {
    result = "New value"
    return .success //Status.success is not mentioned because return type is already given in function declaration
}
